			Agreement</u> (for Alpha, Beta and Pre-Release versions)</h1>

	
	<div class="body conbody">
		<p class="p">[Participants of alpha, beta, and pre-release testing must have "always on" Internet
			access and, depending on the pre-production test stage, must be a SOLIDWORKS Gold
			Partner or a Solution Partner at another level, a hardware vendor that is a SOLIDWORKS
			partner, a vendor providing services to DS SolidWorks under an appropriate vendor
			services agreement, on DS SolidWorks Subscription Service, or otherwise allowed by DS
			SolidWorks to receive a copy of software licensed hereunder.]</p>

		<div class="p">The terms and conditions that follow and any other terms that are specific terms relating
			to identified Software and published at <a class="xref" href="http://www.3ds.com/terms/ost" target="_blank">http://www.3ds.com/terms/ost</a>, hereby
			incorporated by reference, set forth a legal agreement ("Agreement") between Dassault
			Systemes SolidWorks Corporation ("DS SolidWorks") and you, the end user, and cover any
			Alpha, Beta, or Pre-Release version (each, as defined below, a "Non-Commercial Release
			Version") of different offerings consisting of (i) the SOLIDWORKS<sup>®</sup>
			solid modeling software or other product(s) marketed by DS SolidWorks, which may
			include, without limitation, SOLIDWORKS PDM Standard or Professional, SOLIDWORKS
			Simulation, SOLIDWORKS Composer, SOLIDWORKS Documentation Manager, and DraftSight (each
			a "Product"). Because these versions have not yet been released for large-scale
			commercial use, their license terms vary from the standard end-user license terms
			governing DS SolidWorks products. The following is a general description of the
			Non-Commercial Release Versions, each of which corresponds to a phase of the Product
			release cycle:<ul class="ul">
				<li><span class="li"><u class="ph u">Alpha</u> – Pre-production version for functionality evaluation. May be
					unstable and have critical bugs; <strong class="ph b">should never be used in a production
						environment or to modify production data.</strong></span></li>

				<li><span class="li"><u class="ph u">Beta</u> – Pre-production version for quality evaluation. More stable than
					the Alpha version but may be unstable and have critical bugs; <strong class="ph b">should never be
						used in a production environment or to modify production data.</strong></span></li>

				<li><span class="li"><u class="ph u">Pre-Release</u> – The release candidate for First Customer Ship (FCS) and
					final quality evaluation. No known critical instability or critical bugs.
						<strong class="ph b">Except for SOLIDWORKS PDM Standard or Professional and subject to the
						strong recommendation that you create backups of all data, including without
						limitation model files and data, you may elect to use the Pre-Release
						Version of the Product(s), <u class="ph u">other than SOLIDWORKS PDM Standard or
							Professional</u>, in a production environment if you so choose. Under no
						circumstances should SOLIDWORKS PDM Standard or Professional be used in a
						production environment.</strong></span></li>

				<li><span class="li"><u class="ph u">Preliminary Service Pack</u> – Non-public, pre-release version of a
					designated SOLIDWORKS service pack containing one or more updates and fixes and,
					in some circumstances, new features and/or functionality; <strong class="ph b">should never be
						used in a production environment or to modify production data.</strong></span></li>

			</ul>
</div>

		<p class="p">The Product release cycle moves through each of these phases in order. Once a Product is
			released into the next phase, you must discontinue your use of the Product version from
			the previous stage.</p>

		<p class="p">The terms of this Agreement vary depending on the particular Non-Commercial Release
			Version of the Product you are using. You can typically identify the particular
			Non-Commercial Release Version you are using by selecting <b><span class="ph menucascade"><span class="ph uicontrol">Help</span> &gt; <span class="ph uicontrol">About SOLIDWORKS...</span></span></b> (or whichever Product you are using).</p>

		<p class="p">The following terms and conditions additionally govern your use of all the Non-Commercial
			Release Versions of the Products:</p>

		<ol class="ol">
			<li><span class="li">You are granted a personal, nonexclusive, nontransferable, royalty-free and
				temporary license to use the Non-Commercial Release Version of the Product during
				the period from initial delivery of the Non-Commercial Release Version of the
				Product to you until the release of the next phase version or the availability of a
				commercial release version of the Product as described below (the "Non-Commercial
				Release Period"). Such use is solely for your own internal testing purposes. You may
				not sublicense, resell, transfer, assign, lease, rent (including via a timeshare
				arrangement), or distribute the Product or the license granted by this Agreement to
				any third party (other than a third party requiring access to SOLIDWORKS PDM
				Standard or Professional via a Web client or directly via a VPN) or remove the
				Product from the country where you received it. You may not use an Alpha, a Beta, or
				a pre-release Product to develop add-in applications for distribution to one or more
				third parties unless you are allowed to do so as a SOLIDWORKS Solution Partner. DS
				SolidWorks and its licensors retain all right, title, and interest in the Product
				throughout the world, including, without limitation, copyright. You may not copy,
				modify or make works derivative of the Product and you may not analyze for purposes
				competitive to DS SolidWorks or its affiliates, reverse-engineer, decompile,
				disassemble, or otherwise attempt to discover the source code of the Product, as
				such code contains trade secrets of DS SolidWorks and its licensors.</span></li>

			<li><span class="li">DS SolidWorks will provide you with a Non-Commercial Release Version copy of the
				Product and, at DS SolidWorks' sole discretion, updated versions of the Product that
				become available during the Non-Commercial Release Period. <strong class="ph b">The Non-Commercial
					Release Version may also automatically collect certain usage and system data and
					emails the data to DS SolidWorks to give DS SolidWorks additional information
					about stability and the use of the Non-Commercial Release Version and you hereby
					consent to the above.</strong></span></li>

			<li><span class="li">You agree that the Product and related information provided to you at a
				Non-Commercial Release Version site are not commercially available or available for
				any public use whatsoever, and these, <u class="ph u">together with your testing results</u>, are
				the confidential and proprietary trade secret information of DS SolidWorks and its
				licensors ("Confidential Information"). You agree that until the Product or any such
				information is publicly released by DS SolidWorks, you will take at least the same
				precautions to protect the confidentiality of the Confidential Information as you
				take to protect your own confidential information and that you will disclose the
				Confidential Information only to those of your employees who have a need to use the
				Product in connection with your internal testing process. You agree not to make
				Confidential Information available in any form to any third party without the prior
				written consent of DS SolidWorks and not to use the Confidential Information for any
				purpose inconsistent with this Non-Commercial Release License Agreement. You agree
				to take all reasonable steps to ensure that the Confidential Information is not
				disclosed or distributed by your employees in violation of the provisions of this
				paragraph.</span></li>

			<li><span class="li">You acknowledge that you are receiving a Non-Commercial Release Version of the
				Product that may contain software bugs, errors, or other defects, and you agree that
				you will not rely on the performance of the Product in your business without
				adequate back-up, parallel, or contingency measures.</span></li>

			<li><span class="li"><u class="ph u">Alpha and Beta Versions</u> – <strong class="ph b">You must not use the Alpha or Beta version in a
					production environment.</strong> There is no guarantee that (i) model files or data
				will be compatible with any or all versions of the Product, or (ii) later versions
				will neither corrupt files created with earlier versions nor contain critical bugs
				or instabilities. In addition, the access to or operation of certain Alpha, Beta, or
				Pre-release Products may terminate ("time out") after a certain period of time.
					<u class="ph u">There is no assurance that all functionality that appears in the Alpha, Beta,
					or Pre-release version will be available in the commercially-released version of
					the Product.</u></span></li>

			<li><span class="li"><strong class="ph b">DS SolidWorks and its licensors make no warranties with respect to the Product,
					DS SolidWorks' services, or any data or materials produced using the Product,
					including, without limitation, any implied warranties of merchantability,
					non-infringement, and fitness for a particular purpose. DS SolidWorks does not
					warrant that the Software or service will meet your requirements or that the
					operation of the Software will be uninterrupted or error-free or that any
					Internet tool or service will be completely secure. DS SolidWorks and its
					licensors shall have no liability, whether in contract, tort, or otherwise, for
					any damages, including, without limitation, direct, indirect, incidental,
					special, punitive or consequential damages, arising from the Product, use of the
					Product, DS SolidWorks' services, or any data or materials produced using the
					Product.</strong></span></li>

			<li><span class="li">In exchange for the license granted in Section 1 of these terms, you agree to
				provide comments to DS SolidWorks regarding the performance of the Product,
				including reporting any errors in the Product, and to suggest improvements to the
				Product. If you are a user of the Alpha or Beta version of the Product, you also
				agree (i) to participate in periodic telephone feedback sessions, (ii) to respond to
				inquiries, and (iii) to provide such other reasonable feedback as DS SolidWorks may
				request. You acknowledge and agree that DS SolidWorks may incorporate any suggested
				changes or improvements in any release versions of the Product without further
				liability to you, and that DS SolidWorks will own all rights in any modifications or
				improvements it chooses to make to commercially-released versions of the Product as
				a result of your comments.</span></li>

			<li><span class="li">You agree that the Non-Commercial Release License will be in effect until release of
				the commercially released version of the Product, unless earlier terminated by DS
				SolidWorks. DS SolidWorks may terminate this Non-Commercial Release License
				Agreement at any time, for any reason, effective immediately upon written notice to
				you. Upon notice from DS SolidWorks to you of such termination, or of the
				availability of the commercially released version of the Product, you agree to
				destroy all copies of the Non-Commercial Release Version of the Product(s) and
				provide certification of their destruction in a form reasonably acceptable to DS
				SolidWorks. You agree that any use by you of the commercially released version of
				the Product will be subject to the terms of the DS SolidWorks End User License
				Agreement and to the published rates for the commercially released version of the
				Product, copies of which will be furnished to you upon request. All provisions of
				this Agreement shall survive termination <u class="ph u">except</u> the provisions of the first
				sentence of Section 1 and the first and second sentences of Section 7 of this
				Agreement.</span></li>

			<li><span class="li">Export to you of the Product and Documentation is subject to all applicable

				verification, with machine access, copies of system tools outputs, or other
				electronic or hard-copy system information as appropriate. If the audit reveals
				unauthorized use of the Product, you shall promptly pay to DS SolidWorks any
				amount(s) owed as a result of such unauthorized use at the Product's then-current
				list price. If such unauthorized use is five percent (5%) or greater of your
				authorized use with respect to the applicable Product, then, in addition to you
				paying the applicable charges, you shall reimburse DS SolidWorks for the cost of
